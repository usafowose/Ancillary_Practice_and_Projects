// A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you.The bricks width and height are equal, forming a square. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will except these parameters:

// radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
// bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
// rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
// And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.
function iceBrickVolume(radius, bottleLength, rimLength) {
  return (bottleLength - rimLength) * ((Math.pow(radius, 2)) * 2);
}
